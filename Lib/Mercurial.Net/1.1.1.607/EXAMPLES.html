<a href="http://mercurialnet.codeplex.com/">repository</a> requires <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad</a> to run, a free tool made
by the author of <a href="http://www.albahari.com/nutshell/">C# 40 in a Nutshell</a>, a <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>
book about C# 4.0, LINQ and various other topics.</p>

<p>Note that you need <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad</a> version 4.27.1 or higher, as
the scripts here rely on a relatively new feature where the script
can discover its location on disk. This is used so that the scripts work against the
repository of Mercurial.Net automatically.</p>

<p>Ensure that you load up the solution file in Visual Studio 2010,
and do a full rebuild for the Debug target before testing any
of the examples. They rely on the binary produced as part of the
build output.</p>

<p>The examples numbered 100 and upwards are excercising the GUI client,
TortoiseHg.</p>
