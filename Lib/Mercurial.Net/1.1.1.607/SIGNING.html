<html><head><title>SIGNING.markdown</title></head><body><p>One note about the signing of this library. I (Lasse V. Karlsen) will be releasing
binary releases of it, signed with a key I will hold private. </p>

<p>To build these binaries I will be using the special build configuration named
<code>ReleaseBinaries</code>, which will reference the public key of my own private key,
and will thus not build on your machine.</p>

<p>However, both <code>Debug</code> and <code>Release</code> builds will work fine, but note that any
binaries you build on your own machine will be signature-incompatible with any
official binaries I release (when I release them), and so any projects in which
you use these libraries you will have to replace the references if you switch
from a private build to an official one, or vice versa.</p>
