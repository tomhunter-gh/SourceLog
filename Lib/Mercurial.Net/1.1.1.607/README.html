<html><head><title>README.markdown</title></head><body><p>This project contains code to wrap the <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> command-line tool
so that its functions can be used by a .NET application.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can control the <a href="http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/">TortoiseHg</a> GUI clients for
Windows, both the old (PyGTK port) and the new (PyQT port.)</p>

<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p>As this code is getting closer to 1.0, more and more will be stabilized.</p>

<p>At the moment, only the Diff command is slated for a bigger change,
to produce an object model instead of just a text dump. A "RawDiff" command
will be added as well, doing what the current command does.</p>
